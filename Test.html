The volume of a sphere is increasing at a rate of \[25\pi\] cubic meters per hour. At a certain
instant, the volume is \[\dfrac{32\pi}{3}\] cubic meters. What is the rate of change of the surface
area of the sphere at that instant (in square meters per hour)? Choose 1 answer: Choose 1
answer: (Choice A, Incorrect) \[(\sqrt[3]{25\pi})^{^2}\] INCORRECT \[(\sqrt[3]{25\pi})^{^2}\]
(Choice B) \[25\pi\] B \[25\pi\] (Choice C) \[\dfrac{32\pi}{9}\] C \[\dfrac{32\pi}{9}\] (Choice D) \
[\dfrac{25}{16}\] D \[\dfrac{25}{16}\] The surface area of a sphere with radius \[r\] is \[4\pi r^2\].
The volume of a sphere with radius \[r\] is \[\dfrac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]. Let... \[r(t)\] denote the sphere's
radius at time \[t\], \[V(t)\] denote the sphere's volume at time \[t\], and \[S(t)\] denote the
sphere's surface area at time \[t\]. We are given that \[V'(t)=25\pi\], We are also given that \
[V(t_0)=\dfrac{32\pi}{3}\] for a specific time \[t_0\]. We want to find \[S'(t_0)\]. Relating the
measures \[S(t)\] and \[r(t)\] relate to each other through the formula for the surface area of a
sphere: \[S(t)=4\pi[r(t)]^2\] We can differentiate both sides to find an expression for \[S'(t)\]: \
[S'(t)=8\pi r(t)r'(t)\] \[V(t)\] and \[r(t)\] relate to each other through the formula for the volume of a
sphere: \[V(t)=\dfrac{4}{3}\pi[r(t)]^3\] We can differentiate both sides to find an expression for \
[V'(t)\]: \[V'(t)=4\pi[r(t)]^2r'(t)\] Using the information to solve Let's plug \
[\blueD{V(t_0)}=\blueD{\dfrac{32\pi}{3}}\] into the expression for \[V(t_0)\]: \[\begin{aligned}
\blueD{V(t_0)}&=\dfrac{4}3\pi[r(t_0)]^3 \\\\ \blueD{\dfrac{32\pi}{3}}&=\dfrac{4}3\pi[r(t_0)]^3 \\\\
8&=[r(t_0)]^3 \\\\ \goldD{2}&=\goldD{r(t_0)} \end{aligned}\] Let's plug \
[\maroonD{V'(t_0)}=\maroonD{25\pi}\] and \[\goldD{r(t_0)}=\goldD{2}\] into the expression for \
[V'(t_0)\]: \[\begin{aligned} \maroonD{V'(t_0)}&=4\pi[\goldD{r(t_0)}]^2r'(t_0) \\\\
\maroonD{25\pi}&=4\pi(\goldD{2})^2r'(t_0) \\\\ \purpleC{\dfrac{25}{16}}&=\purpleC{r'(t_0)}
\end{aligned}\] Now let's plug \[\goldD{r(t_0)}=\goldD{2}\] and \
[\purpleC{r'(t_0)}=\purpleC{\dfrac{25}{16}}\] into the expression for \[S'(t_0)\]: \[\begin{aligned}
S'(t_0)&=8\pi\goldD{r(t_0)}\purpleC{r'(t_0)} \\\\ &=8\pi(\goldD{2})\left(\purpleC{\dfrac{25}
{16}}\right) \\\\ &=25\pi \end{aligned}\] In conclusion, the rate of change of the surface area of the
sphere at that instant is \[25\pi\] square meters per hour. Since the rate of change is positive, we
know that the surface area is increasing
